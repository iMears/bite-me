# Bite Me Angular Client

##Summary

A voice-controlled recipe app that makes cooking from a recipe a hands-free experiences.

We developed the project in the MEAN stack on decoupled architecture which allowed us to develop both a web app and a mobile app concurrently. Please checkout the [biteme_server](https://github.com/cgardens/biteme_server), repo for the backend to this app.

This was a one-week project at DBC.
